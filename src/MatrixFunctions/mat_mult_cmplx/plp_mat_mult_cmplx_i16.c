/**
  @defgroup MatMultCmplx Complex Matrix Matrix Multiplication
  This module contains the glue code for complex matrix matrix multiplication. The kernel codes
  (kernels) are in the Module @ref MatMultCmplxKernels.

  The Matrix Matrix Multiplication computes the product of two matrices with dimensions MxN and NxO.
  The first matrix is accessed row wise, the second column wise, all values form the first are
  multiplied with the values of the second and then sum of the result gives the value for the result
  matrix.

      pDst[m,o] = pSrcA[m,0]*pSrcB[0,o] + pSrcA[m,1]*pSrcB[1,o] + ... + pSrcA[m,N-1]*pSrcB[N-1,o]

  These functions assume both source matrices (`pSrcA` and `pSrcB`) and the output matrix (`pDstC`)
  to be complex. They must be stored such that real and imaginary part of any element directly are
  directly next to eachother. The dimensionality (`M`, `N`, `O`) still counts the number of elements
  in each dimension, such that a complex matrix X with shape MxN has size `M * N * 2`. To access the
  real and imatinary part of this matrix `X`, do:

      Re(X[m, n]): pX[(m * N + n) * 2]
      Im(X[m, n]): pX[(m * N + n) * 2 + 1]

  There are functions for integer 32- 16- and 8-bit data types. For lower precision integers (16-
  and 8-bit), functions exploiting SIMD instructions are provided.

  The naming scheme of the functions follows the following pattern (for example
  `plp_mat_mult_cmplx_i32`):

      plp_<function name>_<data type><precision>[_parallel]

  name          | description
  ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
  function_name | `mat_mult_cmplx`
  data type     | {f, i, q} respectively for floats, integers, fixed points
  precision     | {32, 16, 8} bits

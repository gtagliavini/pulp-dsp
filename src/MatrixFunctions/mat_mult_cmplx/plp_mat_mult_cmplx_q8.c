  Fix-Point and Shifting
  The result will be shifted by the parameter `shift` to the right (which corresponds to a
  multiplication by `2^-shift`). Assume that matrix A is represente as `pSrcA * 2^-x` and matrix B
  as `pSrcB * 2^-y` (which means that A has `x`, and B has `y` bits after the binary point). Then,
  the output matrix C is represented as `pDstC * 2^-(x + y - shift)`. The output matrix is also
  stored with the same number of bits as the inputs. Set the `shift` parameter such that no overflow
  occurrs.

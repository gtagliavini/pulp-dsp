/**
  @defgroup MatFillI Identity Matrix Creation
  This module contains the glue code for creating identity matrices. The kernel codes (kernels) are
  in the Module @ref matFillIKernels.

  The identity matrix is a square matrix, with the value `1` on it's main diagonal, and all other
  values `0`.

  There are functions for integer 32- 16- and 8-bit data types, as well as for floating-point. The
  naming scheme of the functions follows the following pattern (for example
  `plp_mat_fill_I_i32`):

      `plp_<function name>_<data type><precision>[_parallel]`

  name          | description
  ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
  function_name | `mat_fill_I`
  data type     | {f, i, q} respectively for floats, integers, fixed points
  precision     | {32, 16, 8} bits

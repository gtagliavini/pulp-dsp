  @brief      parallel matrix transpose matrix multiplication for complex 16-bit fix-point on
              XpulpV2
  @param[in]  args  pointer to plp_mat_mat_mult_trans_cmplx_instance_q16 struct initialized by
                    plp_mat_mult_trans_cmplx_q16_parallel
  @return     none

  @par Fix-Point
  Fix-Point and Shifting
  The result will be shifted by the parameter `shift` to the right (which corresponds to a
  multiplication by `2^-shift`). Assume that matrix A is represente as `pSrcA * 2^-x` and matrix B
  as `pSrcB * 2^-y` (which means that A has `x`, and B has `y` bits after the binary point). Then,
  the output matrix C is represented as `pDstC * 2^-(x + y - shift)`. The output matrix is also
  stored with the same number of bits as the inputs. Set the `shift` parameter such that no overflow
  occurrs.

  @par Exploiting SIMD instructions
  The 16 bit values are packed two each into 32 bit vectors and then the two dot products are
  performed on 32 bit vectors, with 32 bit accumulator.

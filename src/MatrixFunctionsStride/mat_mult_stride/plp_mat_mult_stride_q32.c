  @brief Glue code for strided matrix multiplication of 32-bit fix-point matrices.
  @param[in]  pSrcA     points to the first input matrix
  @param[in]  pSrcB     points to the second input matrix
  @param[in]  M         height of the first input matrix
  @param[in]  N         width of the first input matrix and hight of the second
  @param[in]  O         width of the second input matrix
  @param[in]  strideA   Stride of matrix A (elements between each row)
  @param[in]  strideB   Stride of matrix B (elements between each row)
  @param[in]  strideC   Stride of output matrix (elements between each row)
  @param[in]  shift     Amount to shift the result of each multiplication.
  @param[out] pDstC     points to the output matrix
  @return        none

  @par Fix-Point and Shifting
  The result will be shifted by the parameter `shift` to the right (multiplied
  by 2^-shift). Assume that matrix A is represented as pSrcA * 2^-x, and matrix
  B as pSrcB * 2^-y (in other words, A has it's x last digits after the binary
  point). Then, the output is represented as pDstC * 2^-(x + y - shift).

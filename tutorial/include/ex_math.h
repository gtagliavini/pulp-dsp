   *
   * Introduction
   * ------------
   *
   * This user manual describes the PULP DSP software library,
   * a suite of common signal processing functions for use on PULP-based processors.
   *
   * The library is divided into a number of functions each covering a specific category:
   * - Basic math functions
   * - Fast math functions
   * - Complex math functions
   * - Filters
   * - Matrix functions
   * - Transform functions
   * - Motor control functions
   * - Statistical functions
   * - Support functions
   * - Interpolation functions
   *
   * The library has separate functions for operating on 8-bit integers, 16-bit integers,
   * 32-bit integer and 32-bit floating-point values.
   *
   * The library is released under Apache v2.0 license.
   *

/**
 * @defgroup groupMath Basic Math Functions
 * The naming scheme of the functions follows the following pattern (for example
 ex_dot_prod_i32s_rv32im): <pre>
 \<pulp\> _ \<function name\> _ \<data type\> \<precision\> \<method\> _ \<isa extension\>, with

 data type = {f, i, q} respectively for floats, integers, fixed points

 precision = {32, 16, 8} bits

 method = {s, p} respectively meaning single core or parallel multicore implementation.

 isa extension = rv32im, xpulpv2, etc. of which rv32im is the most general one.
